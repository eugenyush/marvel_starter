- **React Router**

## ðŸ‘¾ Features

- Search for any Marvel character and view detailed information.
- Explore Marvel comics with descriptions, pages, language, and pricing details.

- Error handling for API issues and loading states with spinners.
- Data fetched in real-time from the Marvel API.

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by implementing the basic structure of the application with React and connected it to the Marvel API. The next step was to create the components for displaying character and comic data, followed by adding routes using React Router.

Once the basic functionality was working, I focused on styling the application using SCSS to ensure a clean and responsive design.

Subsequent improvements included error handling (with spinners and error messages) and performance optimizations such as reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving data-fetching strategies.

Everything is displayed using the data provided by the Marvel API, so users can access the latest information in real-time.

**NOTE:** The purpose of this project is to demonstrate usage of the Marvel API with React. It is not meant to be a complete Marvel fan application.
